\section{Introduction} 

\subsection{Time-Series prediction}
Since the beginning of financial markets, their participants have had the desire to predict the future values of instruments being traded there. And for this purposes, they have used many different techniques - majority of which have fallen short of randomly guessing the direction of the price movement. In the past few decades, many models have emerged which claim excellent capability of time-series prediction. First were the statistical models (such as ARIMA), then the Machine Learning models (such as XGBoost), then Deep Learning models (such as DeepAR). 

\subsection{Transformer-based Models}

The revolution in the field of Machine Learning came in 2017 with the invention of the Transformer architecture (more specifically: the attention mechanism). Transformer based models have taken the whole field of ML by storm, however, their application has mostly been in the sub-field of Natural Language Processing. Recently they started seeing use in the field of time-series prediction (eg. Informer). 

\subsubsection{Time Series Foundation Models (TSFM)}

Time-series foundation models are large transformer-based models which are designed for the purpose of time-series prediction and which have been pre-trained on a large amount of time-series data. This research will explore their use on financial time-series data
